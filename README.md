1. Core Technologies
   • TypeScript: Your project must be fully written in TypeScript, with proper types,
   interfaces, and strict type checking.
2. Application Functionality
   • Error Handling: Implement proper error handling for API requests (e.g., loading
   states, error messages, retries if necessary).
3. Code Quality & Best Practices
   • Type Safety: Use TypeScript features properly (e.g., interfaces, types, generics).
   • Responsive Design: Ensure your app is usable on both desktop and mobile
   devices.

To Do:

- Error handling for api requests
- Check to make sure all proper use cases for types are used
