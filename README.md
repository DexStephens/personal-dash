1. Core Technologies
   • TypeScript: Your project must be fully written in TypeScript, with proper types,
   interfaces, and strict type checking.
   • React: Use React (functional components with hooks) to build your UI.
   • API Interaction: Your app must fetch data from at least one web API (e.g.,
   OpenWeather, NASA, Spotify, GitHub, etc.).
2. Application Functionality
   • User Interaction: The app must have a meaningful user interaction aspect to it.
   • State Management: Use React state management effectively (e.g., useState,
   useReducer, etc.).
   • Error Handling: Implement proper error handling for API requests (e.g., loading
   states, error messages, retries if necessary).
   • Routing: There should be some form of navigation using a router.
3. Code Quality & Best Practices
   • Project Structure: Organize your code into meaningful components, hooks, and
   utility files.
   • Type Safety: Use TypeScript features properly (e.g., interfaces, types, generics).
   • Code Readability: Your code should be well-structured, with meaningful variable
   and function names, and proper comments where necessary.
   • Responsive Design: Ensure your app is usable on both desktop and mobile
   devices.
4. Additional Enhancements (Optional but Encouraged)
   • Custom Hooks: If applicable, create reusable custom hooks.
   • Styling Frameworks: You may use Tailwind, Material UI, or Styled Components for
   styling.
   • Persistent Data: If relevant, implement local storage or a database (Firebase,
   Supabase, etc.).
   • Authentication: I recommend that you try to use an API that doesn’t need
   authentication. You have enough other things to work on. But if using an API that
   requires authentication, implement a login system (OAuth, Firebase Auth, etc.).
   • Third-Party Library: It would be nice if you integrated one or more third-party
   libraries into your project. (E.g. Google’s JavaScript Maps API is a third-party
   library.) Integrating libraries is a skill you will most definitely need as a professional
   web developer

To Do:

- Create landing page, where they can signup or login
- Start styling the setup
- Finish building out the initial walk through process
- Setup top level user context, and auto user logging in for oauth
